# AVL Tree Visualization Web App

Welcome to the **AVL Tree Simulation Web App**, a tool designed to help users understand the behavior of AVL trees. This project supports the insertion, deletion, and searching of both numbers and words, while visually showcasing the balancing operations of an AVL tree.

## Features

- üå≥ **AVL Tree Visualization**: See how nodes are arranged and balanced dynamically.
- üî¢ **Supports Numbers and Words**: Insert either numbers or words. Words are compared alphabetically.
- üñºÔ∏è **Intuitive User Interface**: Interact with the tree through a clean canvas and input fields.
- üé® **Responsive Design**: Works on devices of all sizes.
- ‚ú® **Smooth Animations**: Node movements and balancing actions are animated for better understanding.

## Live Preview

You can experience the app directly here: **[AVL Tree Web App](https://sfsd-avl.netlify.app/)**.

## Demo

### How It Works:
1. Enter a word or number into the input field.
2. Choose an operation:
   - **Insert**: Adds the value to the tree.
   - **Search**: Highlights the value in the tree if found.
   - **Delete**: Removes the value from the tree and re-balances it.
3. Observe the AVL tree dynamically adjust itself on the canvas.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Core technologies for structure, style, and interaction.
- **Canvas API**: For rendering and animating the AVL tree.
- **Custom CSS**: For styling, including responsiveness and animations.
